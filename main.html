	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>
Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science, measuring the efficiency of algorithms in terms of the time they require for execution relative to the size of the input. efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, requiring fewer computational resources to solve a problem. Understanding time complexity helps developers choose the most suitable algorithm for their applications, balancing factors like speed and scalability.</p>
	<p>
<b>Space Complexity</b>, represented as O(n), is a critical aspect of algorithm analysis that assesses the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to its input size. It measures the maximum memory required by an algorithm as a function of the input size. Algorithms with lower Space complexity are considered more memory-efficient, making them ideal for memory-constrained environments. Understanding space complexity helps developers optimize their code for improved performance and scalability, particularly in scenarios where memory usage is a crucial consideration.</p>
